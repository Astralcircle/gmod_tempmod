What addon?:

This addon adds more realism to your game in temperature. If you have played People Playground, then you will understand exactly what this addon is. This addon has some pretty interesting features, which I have described below in the description. Unfortunately the temperature only works on props

Commands:

set_temp <number> - set the temperature of the prop you have on your sight

get_temp - get the temperature of the prop you have in sight

You can find the rest of the commands by typing "tempmod_ ..."

Features:

Temperature spread.

Lowering the temperature to normal, as indicated in the utilities.

Props that burn also spread heat to other props in the vicinity.

Extensive customization of the addon, which is done through utilities or commands. (Clientside and Serverside)

Temperature reduces the HP of an object and can be turned off via utilities or the console.

Burns to NPCs and Players from touching hot/cold props

Detailed metal that has its own effects and all sorts of gags.
